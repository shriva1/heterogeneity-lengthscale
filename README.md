# **Scale of Heterogeneity**



This repository contains code for analyzing optical data of NMC cathodes using Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts. All datasets (Excel files, images) are available separately on Zenodo.



#### **Contents**



code\_files/ : contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for processing and plotting.



Data files are **not** included here – see link below



#### **How to Run**



Download the data files from Zenodo: \[Zenodo DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.15870101](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15870101)]



Place the downloaded files in the same directory as the notebooks.



For Python Scripts: Open or code\_files/'....'.py

For Jupyter Notebooks: Open code\_files/'....'.ipynb and run the cells step-by-step. Replace the input file path wherever necessary.
